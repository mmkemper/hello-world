# hello-world
This is the repository I have created for the Hello World tutorial. I am completing this to get credit for my PSYCH 4802 course (week 2 assignment). 
My name is Morgan. [^1] I am a Millenial who grew up out in the countryside and didn't have a computer with internet access until high school. I remember using HTML when I was updating my *Myspace* page at the local library. As a freshman in college I took a C++ language course [^2] and that was really **all** I've done with coding up to this point in my life. I plan on going to grad school, so now is a good time to learn more! 
[^1] Some people call me Marcus. I am still debating how to handle my transness, so I still go by my birth name at work.
[^2] It was already really old by that point.
